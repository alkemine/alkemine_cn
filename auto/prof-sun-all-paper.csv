The present work demonstrated that this process was one of the most effective and simple methods for the preparation of dense bulk Ti3SiC2 materials. Lattice constants of a=3.068 and c=17.645 are calculated for Ti3SiC2 made through this process. The synthesis temperature influenced the phase composition, microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti3SiC2 prepared at different temperatures. And bulk materials with flexural strength of 480 MPa and fracture toughness of 7.88 MPa.m1/2 were obtained at 1600°C.

The raw materials used in this process are Ti, Si, and graphite powders. Fluctuation synthesis utilized Si as in-situ liquid forming phase (additive), which was formed by heating the powder mixtures to 1300°C and using the heat released from the exothermic reaction for Ti3SiC2 formation. The result demonstrated that the reaction time for the formation of Ti3SiC2 was dramatically shortened using fluctuation method and the powders produced using this method contained more than twice amount of Ti3SiC2 compared to the solid reaction synthesized powders. The powders prepared by fluctuation method are fiber-like in morphology with dimensions of 0.8–2 µm in width and 5–10 µm in length. The growth direction of the fiber-like Ti3SiC2 particulate is {101 – 1}*. The lattice parameters for Ti3SiC2 were determined by a trial-and-error method and are a=3.067 Å and c=17.645 Å.",

",1999innova-zhouyc-microstructure_and_mechnism.pdf,1999innova-zhouyc-microstructure and mechnism.jpg," Titanium silicon carbide (Ti3SiC2) is a damage tolerance material that is expected to be used in a number of high temperature applications. In this work, the microstructure and damage tolerance mechanism of Ti3SiC2 was investigated. The result demonstrated that the Ti3SiC2 ceramics prepared by the in-situ hot pressing/solid-liquid reaction process had a dual microstructure, i.e., large laminated grains were distributed within small equiaxial grains. This microstructure is analogous to that of platelets reinforced ceramic matrix composites. The bending test using single-edge-notched-beam specimens revealed that Ti3SiC2 was a damage tolerance material. The damage tolerance mechanisms for Ti3SiC2 are basal plane slip, grain buckling, crack deflection, crack branching, pull-out and delamination of the laminated grains.",

The microstructure, mechanical and electrical properties of the Cu/Ti3SiC2 composites were investigated and were compared with those of Cu/graphite composites. The results demonstrated that Cu/Ti3SiC2 composites had superior mechanical properties over Cu/graphite composites. At filer content of less than 20 vol%, the electrical conductivity for Cu/Ti3SiC2 composites was higher than that for Cu/graphite composites; at high filer content, the electrical conductivity for Cu/Ti3SiC2 composites was lower than that for Cu/graphite composites because of the presence of residual pores. It was found that like Cu/graphite composite, Cu/Ti3SiC2 was a self-lubricated material.

The effect of strain rates on high-temperature compressive property was also investigated. Polycrystalline Ti3SiC2 exhibited positive temperature dependence of flow stress (flow stress anomaly) and showed a temperature peak at 1173 K. The brittle-to-ductile transition temperature (BDTT) for polycrystalline Ti3SiC2 was strainrate sensitive, an approximately 100 K decrease in transition temperature was associated with four times of magnitude decrease in strain rate. In addition, the fracture morphology changed from predominately intergranular to mostly transgranular. The mechanism responsible for the brittle-to-ductile transition in Ti3SiC2 was involved in the onset of a thermally activated deformation process.",

SYNTHESIS OF Ti3SiC2 POWDERS BY A SOLID-LIQUID REACTION PROCESS,Sun Zhimei,Zhang Yi ,-,"Sun Zhimei,Zhang Yi,Zhou Yanchun ",Scripta Materialia,Q2,4.539,41,1,61-66,1999,Elsevier Ltd,https://doi.org/10.1016/S1359-6462(99)00054-8,1999scripta-sun_scripta_1999.pdf,1999scripta-sun_scripta_1999.jpg,"Ti3SiC2 is a novel ceramic material, which combines the merit of both metals and ceramics. Like metals it is thermal and electrical conductive, easy to machine with conventional tools, and resistant to thermal shock; like ceramics it has high strength, high melting point and thermal stability (1). Ti3SiC2 has hexagonal crystal structure with space group of P63/mmc. The theoretical density of Ti3SiC2 is 4.53g/cm3 and the melting point exceeds 3000 °C. The measured Young’s modulus is 320 GPa and microhardness is 4 GPa (2). Despite the remarkable properties, synthesis of Ti3SiC2 is difficult. Jeitschko et al (3) synthesized pure Ti3SiC2 through chemical reaction between TiH2, Si and graphite, but the method is limited to laboratory scale by its efficiency. Recently, a number of methods including self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) (4), arc-melting (5) and solid-state reaction (6) have been utilized to synthesize Ti3SiC2. In most of these methods carbides (e.g. TiC or SiC) and silicides (e.g. Ti5Si3, TiSi2) were co-existing with Ti3SiC2 in the product. Thus work is needed to develop new methods for the synthesis of Ti3SiC2. In this paper, a solid-liquid process for the formation of Ti3SiC2 powders was reported. The starting materials are Ti, Si and graphite powders, and the liquid phase was formed by the addition of fluorite, i.e., NaF. The Ti3SiC2 powders prepared using this process were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The effect of synthesis temperature on the composition of the reaction products was investigated by quantitative X-ray analysis.",
Crystallographic relations between Ti3SiC2 and TiC,Yanchun Zhou ,Zhimei Sun ,Yanchun Zhou ,"Yanchun Zhou,Zhimei Sun",Materials Research Innovations,Q3,0.473,3,5,286-291,2000,MANEY PUBLISHING,https://doi.org/10.1007/PL00010876,2000inno-zhou_innovations_2000.pdf,2000inno-zhou_innovations_2000.jpg," Ti3SiC2 is a so-called not-so-brittle ceramic that combines the merits of both metals and ceramics. However, many previous works demonstrated that its bonding nature and properties were strongly related to TiC. In this paper the crystallographic relations between Ti3SiC2 and TiC were established and described based on the transmission electron microscopy investigation on the Ti3SiC2/TiC interface in Ti3SiC2 based material. At Ti3SiC2/TiC interface, the following crystallographic relationships were identified: (111)TiC//(001)Ti3SiC2, (002) TiC//(104)Ti3SiC2, and [11 ¯0]TiC//[110]Ti3SiC2. Based on the above interfacial relations an interfacial structure model was established. The structure of Ti3SiC2 could be considered as two-dimensional closed packed layers of Si periodically intercalated into the (111) twin boundary of TiC0.67 (Ti3C2). The intercalation resulted in the transformation from cubic TiC0.67 to hexagonal Ti3SiC2. In the opposite case, de-intercalation of Si from Ti3SiC2 caused the transformation from hexagonal Ti3SiC2 to cubic TiC0.67. Understanding the crystallographic relations between Ti3SiC2 and TiC is of vital importance in both understanding the properties and optimizing the processing route for preparing pure Ti3SiC2.",

The present results demonstrated that the scale growth on Ti3SiC2-base material obeyed a parabolic rate law up to 20 cycles. It then changed to a linear rate with further increasing cycles. The scales formed on the Ti3SiC2-base material were composed of an inward-growing, fine-grain mixture of TiO2+SiO2 and an outward-growing, coarse-grain TiO2. Theoretical calculations show that the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between the inner scale and Ti3SiC2-base matrix is small. The outer TiO2 layer was under very low compressive stress, while the inner TiO2+SiO2 layer was under tensile stress during cooling. Scale spallation is, therefore, not expected and the scale formed on Ti3SiC2-base material is adherent and resistant to cyclic oxidation.",

The stress–strain analysis of this deformation mode reveals Nb–Al bond breaking, while the Nb–C bond length decreases by 4.1%. Furthermore, there is no evidence for phase transformation during deformation. This is consistent with basal slip and may be understood on the basis of the electronic structure: bands below the Fermi level are responsible for the dd bonding between NbC basal planes and only a single band with a weak dd interaction is not resistant to shearing, while all other bands are unaffected. The Al–Nb bonding character can be described as mainly metallic with weak covalent–ionic contributions. Our study demonstrates that Al layers move with relative ease under shear strain. Phase conservation upon shearing is unusual for carbides and may be due to the layered nature of the phase studied. Here, we describe the electronic origin of basal slip in Nb2AlC, the atomic mechanism which enables reversible plasticity in this class of materials.",

We propose that these phases can be classified into two groups based on the valence electron concentration induced changes in C44. One group comprises M=V B and VIB, where the C44 values are approximately 170 GPa and independent of the corresponding MC. The other group includes M=IIIB and IVB, where the C44 shows a linear dependency with the corresponding MC. This may be understood based on the electronic structure: shear resistant bands are filled in M2AlC phases with M=V B and VIB, while they are not completely filled when M=IIIB and IVB. This notion is also consistent with our stress–strain analysis. These valence electron concentration induced changes in shear behaviour were compared to previously published valence electron concentration induced changes in compression behaviour [Z. Sun, D. Music, R. Ahuja, S. Li, J.M. Schneider, Phys. Rev. B 70 (2004) 092102]. These classification proposals exhibit identical critical valence electron concentration values for the group boundary.

This type of data storage is achieved by the fast reversible phase transition between amorphous and crystalline GST upon heat pulse. Here we report pressure-induced reversible crystalline-amorphous and polymorphic amorphous transitions in NaCl structured GST by ab initio molecular dynamics calculations. We have showed that the onset amorphization of GST starts at approximately 18 GPa and the system become completely random at approximately 22 GPa. This amorphous state has a cubic framework (c-amorphous) of sixfold coordinations. With further increasing pressure, the c-amorphous transforms to a high-density amorphous structure with trigonal framework (t-amorphous) and an average coordination number of eight. The pressure-induced amorphization is investigated to be due to large displacements of Te atoms for which weak Te–Te bonds exist or vacancies are nearby. Upon decompressing to ambient conditions, the original cubic crystalline structure is restored for c-amorphous, whereas t-amorphous transforms to another amorphous phase that is similar to the melt-quenched amorphous GST.",

Amorphous structure melt-quenched from defective Ge2Sb2Te5,"Sun, Zhimei",-,"Sun, Zhimei","Sun, Zhimei",JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE,Q2,3.442,47,21,7635-7641,2012,"SPRINGER, 233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10853-012-6607-8,2012jms-sun-JMS-invited-2012.pdf,2012jms-sun-JMS-invited-2012.jpg,"Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) is a technologically important phase-change material for data storage, where the fast reversible phase transition between crystalline and amorphous states is used for recording information. The encoding is achieved by the large contrast in physical properties between the two states. Ge vacancies (V-Ge) and Sb antisite atoms (Sb-Te) are primary point defects in crystalline GST. The effect of V-Ge and Sb-Te on the atomic arrangements in amorphous GST is unknown, which, however, has significant effects on the performance of GST. In this work, by means of ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, the atomic arrangements in amorphous ideal and defective GST have been investigated. The results show that the amorphous structure of GST with Sb-Te (St-GST) or with V-Ge (V-GST) has the same cubic framework and close chemical ordering to ideal GST, and hence similar fast reversible phase transition behavior is expected in the defective phases. Furthermore, the presence of Sb-Te or V-Ge in the crystalline phase will result in much more Ge atoms in a tetrahedral geometry as well as in a fourfold octahedral environment in the amorphous state. Especially in V-GST, around 36 % Ge atoms occupy a fourfold octahedral geometry. As fourfold octahedral Ge atoms can enhance the large contrast in physical properties between the crystalline and amorphous phases, introducing Ge vacancies would be an efficient way to improve the performance of GST phase-change materials.",

The crystal structure of the title compound can be derived from breaking the cuprate planar layer to form isolated, nonplanar triangular copper trimers ({[Cu3(μ3-Cl)(OH)3](OH)6Cl2}6−), which are connected by strontium coordination spheres to form a novel framework structure. The copper trimers exhibit an unprecedented array that has triangular Cu3-planes perpendicular not only to their own layer but also to their counterparts in the next layers, which is thus different from the parallel array in the Kagomé layer of ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2.

Such remarkable magnetic properties make the title compound a Mott insulator – an ordered inorganic solid with Cu spin-1/2 spins forming an intrinsic “molecular magnet”.",

These structures support a control of hydrogen on the depolymerization of [PO4] groups and our work opens a new way for the synthesis of other novel phosphates using controlled water activities.",

However, their applications in spintronics have been limited by the lack of intrinsic magnetism. Here, using hybrid density functional theory, we predict ferromagnetic behavior in a graphene-like two-dimensional Cr2C crystal that belongs to the MXenes family. The ferromagnetism, arising from the itinerant Cr d electrons, introduces intrinsic half-metallicity in Cr2C MXene, with the half-metallic gap as large as 2.85 eV. We also demonstrate a ferromagnetic–antiferromagnetic transition accompanied by a metal to insulator transition in Cr2C, caused by surface functionalization with F, OH, H, or Cl groups. Moreover, the energy gap of the antiferromagnetic insulating state is controllable by changing the type of functional groups. We further point out that the localization of Cr d electrons induced by the surface functionalization is responsible for the ferromagnetic–antiferromagnetic and metal to insulator transitions. Our results highlight a new promising material with tunable magnetic and electronic properties toward nanoscale spintronics and electronics applications.",

The occupation preferences of the alloying elements depend on their relative atomic radii respect to either Nb or Si. Furthermore, the dissolution of the alloying elements is easier at high temperatures by the Debye model analysis, from which the homogenization-treatment temperatures of alloyed Nb5Si3 phases are also deduced. All alloyed Nb5Si3 phases are mechanically stable, even though their mechanical properties like ductility are not improved.

The QSH phase which is confirmed by the nontrivial Z2 topological invariant and Dirac edge states arises from a d–d band inversion between the M-dxy,x2 y2 and the Mo-dz2 orbitals and a spin–orbital coupling (SOC)-induced splitting of the M-dxy,x2 y2 orbital at the G point. With different M atoms, the QSH gap of Mo2M2C3O2 ranges from 38 to 152 meV. These findings will broaden the scientific and technological impacts of both QSH materials and MXenes.",

The resistive switching (RS) in Ta2O5-based RRAM is generally believed to be due to the diffusion of oxygen vacancy (Vo) inside the oxide, while the role of metal interstitials is paid less attention. Here, on the basis of first-principles calculations, we show that the role of interstitial Ta (Tai) is competitive under the oxygen-poor condition and should also contribute to RS in Ta2O5. This is obvious by our calculated comparable energy barriers for the diffusion of Vo and Tai, which are 3.5 and 3.7 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the presence of electric field in working devices will enhance the migration of Tai due to its higher charge states compared to Vo. Meanwhile, Tai will introduce more defect states closer to the conduction bands and, thus, is more effective on tuning the electronic structure of Ta2O5. The present work unravels the contribution of Ta cations in RS of tantalum oxidebased RRAM, presenting a synergistic RS mechanism of oxygen vacancies and metal interstitials, which should be helpful for optimizing and designing novel RRAM devices.",

Here, by combining structure-searching algorithm and first-principles calculations, we identified structures that are more stable than the ideal rock-salt for the early TM−MOs (TM = Ti, Hf, V, Ta). For TiO, HfO, and TaO, ground state symmetries of P6̅2M), I41/AMD and P1̅ are obtained, respectively, which have distinct structural and electronic properties compared to the rock-salt structure. However, it is rather complex for the case of VO due to the existence of magnetic ordering. For VO, magnetic ordering behavior exists in the rock-salt and the predicted P1̅ structure according to the hybrid functional calculations. After relaxation, the magnetic ordering causes local distortion in the original rock-salt structure, leading to a R3̅M symmetry, which becomes more stable than the predicted P1̅ structure. Furthermore, the ionic TM−O bonding of the predicted phases is rather weaker than that of their rock-salt counterparts. While the enhanced metal−metal bonding characterized by the distances between the nearest-neighboring metallic atoms is found to be responsible for the stabilization of the ground state structures discovered here. Our findings deepen the understanding of the ground state of early TM−MOs, which is vital for the unraveling of the complete physical picture for transition metal monoxides.",

A tight-binding (TB) model based on the dz2-, dxy-, and dx2.y2-orbital basis in a triangular lattice is also constructed to describe the QSH states in Mo2MC2O2. It shows that the atomic spin.orbit coupling (SOC) strength of M totally contributes to the topological gap at the Γ point, a useful feature dvantageous over the usual cases where the topological gap is much smaller than the atomic SOC strength based on the classic Kane.Mele (KM) or Bernevig. Hughes.Zhang (BHZ) model. Consequently, Mo2MC2O2 show sizable gaps from 0.1 to 0.2 eV with different M atoms, sufficiently large for realizing room-temperature QSH effects. Another advantage of Mo2MC2O2 MXenes lies in their oxygencovered

In this work, on the basis of ab initio calculations, we have identified yttrium (Y) as an optimal dopant for Sb2Te3, which overcomes the phase separation problem and significantly increases the resistivity of crystalline state by at least double that of Sb2Te3. The good phase stability of crystalline Y-doped Sb2Te3 (YST) is attributed to the same crystal structure between Y2Te3 and Sb2Te3 as well as their tiny lattice mismatch of only ∼1.1%. The significant increase in resistivity of c-YST is understood by our findings that Y can dramatically increase the carrier’s effective mass by regulating the band structure and can also reduce the intrinsic carrier density by suppressing the formation of SbTe antisite defects. Y doping can also improve the thermal stability of amorphous YST based on our ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which is attributed to the stronger interactions between Y and Te than that of Sb and Te.",

Here, we show how the catalytic performance of MoS2 monolayers can be improved dramatically by catalyst size reduction and surface sulfur (S) depletion. Monolayered MoS2 nanocrystals (NCs) (2–25 nm) produced via exfoliating and disintegrating their bulk counterparts showed improved catalysis rates over monolayer sheets because of their increased edge ratios and metallicity. Subsequent S depletion of these NCs further improved the metallicity and made Mo atoms on the basal plane become catalytically active. As a result, the S-depleted NCs with low mass (∼1.2 μg) showed super high catalytic performance on HER with a low Tafel slope of ∼29 mV/decade, overpotentials of 60–75 mV, and high current densities jx (where x is in mV) of j150 = 9.64 mA·cm–2 and j200 = 52.13 mA·cm–2. We have found that higher production rates of H2 could not be achieved by adding more NC layers since HER only happens on the topmost surface and the charge mobility decreases dramatically. These difficulties can be largely alleviated by creating a hybrid structure of NCs immobilized onto three-dimensional graphene to provide a very high surface exposure of the catalyst for electrochemical HER, resulting in very high current densities of j150 = 49.5 mA·cm–2 and j200 = 232 mA·cm–2 with ∼14.3 μg of NCs. Our experimental and theoretical studies show how careful design and modification of nanoscale materials/structures can result in highly efficient catalysis. There may be considerable opportunities in the broader family of transition metal dichalcogenides beyond just MoS2 to develop highly efficient atomically thin catalysts. These could offer cheap and effective replacement of precious metal catalysts in clean energy production.",

The calculated results show that a Ni vacancy on (001)g0 plane does not change the most preferable substitution position of the alloying elements at corner-point Ni site on (001)g except Cr. These alloying elements in g0 enhance the interfacial bonding strength of g/g0 interface even with the presence of a neighboring vacancy, among which Re exhibits the best strengthening effect. The improvement in the g/g0 interfacial strength is ascribed to the increased chemical bonding strength between the alloying atom and the nearest-neighbor host atom. Furthermore, a single Ni vacancy has higher migration energy barriers around the alloying solutes especially Re solute substituting on (001)g at g/g0 interface, although the alloying solutes at these preferable sites have no contribution to the interfacial bonding strength.",

In this work, the phonon dispersions, lattice distortions, and elastic constants of TcO2 at external pressures up to 120 GPa were comprehensively studied using first-principles calculations. It is found that the lattice dynamic stability of TcO2 can be assessed by fitting the Γ.Z acoustical phonon branch. The applied external pressure can be divided into three ranges: the low-pressure stable range, the middle-pressure buckling range, and the high-pressure unstable range. Interestingly, the variation tendency of the low-pressure stable range is very close to that of the high-pressure unstable range. On the other hand, the TcO2 lattice responds intensely to external pressure in the middle-pressure buckling range, which can be sustained under about 71 GPa pressure. More importantly, we have unraveled the pressure-induced lattice distortion in TcO2, which leads to anomalous behaviors for the lattice constants, Tc.O bond lengths, and elastic constants at 10 and 20 GPa external pressures.",

In this study, first-principles calculations are performed to study the segregation effects of four mostly-used solutes (Y, Ti, Cr and Si) on the cohesion of two distinct grain boundaries (GBs) of Nb. Based on Rice-Wang Model, it is found that Y embrittles the GB; while Ti and Si strengthen it; the effect of Cr on the GB cohesion is structure-dependent. The strengthening/embrittling of the GBs induced by the segregation are attributed to the local structural distortion and charge redistributions around GBs. The underlying physical origin of different alloying effects on the intergranular fracture are identified to be the variation of bonding characters between the host NbeNb atoms across the GB regions.",

The j of phase change materials in both amorphous and crystalline phases should be quite small, because it determines how energy-efficient the PCM device is during programming. At a high temperature, the electronic thermal conductivity (je) is always notable for semiconductors, which is still lacking for antimony telluride under doping in the literature as far as we know. In this paper, using density functional theory and Boltzmann transport equations, we report calculations of lattice thermal conductivity jL and electronic thermal conductivity je of the yttrium doped antimony telluride. We show that the average value of thermal conductivity decreases from  2.5W m-1K-1 for Sb2Te3 to  1.5W m-1K-1 for Y0.167Sb1.833Te3. This can be attributed to the reduced jL and je, especially the je at high temperature (near melting point). We further point out that the increased effective mass of carriers and the flat valance band edge are responsible for the decrease of je. The reduced thermal conductivity is highly desirable for the decrease of heat dissipation and transport in PCM operations, which can increase the density of memory and reduce energy consumption.",

Interestingly, the locations of the CBM or VBM in MXene/BlueP vdW heterostructures can also be reversed by compressive or tensile strain between the building layers, which indicates that either layer can be utilized as an electron donor or acceptor by varying its deformation conditions. Meanwhile, this compressive (tensile) strain can also induce a red (blue) shift in the optical absorption spectra of MXene/BlueP vdW heterostructures. Finally, our results on the mechanical flexibility and deformation mechanism of MXene/BlueP vdW heterostructures suggest their great long-term stability as well as promising applications in flexible devices.

However, the microscopic role of oxygen in the write-erase process, i.e., the reversible phase transition between crystalline and amorphous state of phase-change materials is not clear yet. Using oxygen doped GeTe as an example, this work unravels the role of oxygen at the atomic scale by means of ab initio total energy calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our main finding is that after the amorphization and the subsequent re-crystallization process simulated by ab initio molecular dynamics, oxygen will drag one Ge atom out of its lattice site and both atoms stay in the interstitial region near the Te vacancy that was originally occupied by the oxygen, forming a ""dumbbell-like"" defect (O-VTe-Ge), which is in sharp contrast to the results of ab initio total energy calculations at 0 K showing that the oxygen prefers to substitute Te in crystalline GeTe. This specific defect configuration is found to be responsible for the slower crystallization speed and hence the improved data retention of oxygen doped GeTe as reported in recent experimental work. Moreover, we find that the oxygen will increase the effective mass of the carrier and thus increases the resistivity of GeTe. Our results unravel the microscopic mechanism of the oxygen-doping optimization of phase-change material GeTe, and the present reported mechanism can be applied to other oxygen doped ternary chalcogenide phase-change materials.",

Blue Phosphorene (BlueP) is a promising 2D semiconductor for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we report that Zr-, Hf- and Nb-based 2D transition metal carbides (MXenes) are ideal electrode materials for BlueP based on extensive investigations of the electronic properties and interfacial Schottky barrier characteristics of BlueP/MXene heterojunctions by first-principles calculations. Our results show that the strong interaction between BlueP and bare MXenes destroys the semiconducting character of BlueP, and thus bare MXenes are not ideal contact electrodes. While with the surface functionalization of MXene, the intrinsic electronic feature of BlueP is well preserved in the BlueP/surface-engineered MXene heterojunctions. Furthermore, the interfacial Schottky barriers of the heterojunctions are affected by the terminal surface groups on MXenes and vanishing Schottky barriers are achieved in some MXenes with the formula Zrn+1CnF2, Hfn+1CnF2, Zrn+1Cn(OH)2, Hfn+1Cn(OH)2 and Nbn+1Cn(OH)2. Finally, we demonstrate that the work functions of MXenes and the interface dipole induced by charge rearrangement are two underlying factors to determine the magnitude of Schottky barriers. This work provides fundamentals for selecting ideal electrode material for BlueP and is also beneficial for optimizing electrodes for other 2D semiconductors.",

In addition, this preparation efficiently avoids fast charge recombination associated with MoS2, improves light harvesting, and gives a newly formed metallic state to transfer electrons for photocatalytic reactions. By way of example, we have demonstrated remarkable photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) and methylene orange (MO) dyes using the S-depleted Mo-S nanocrystals (NCs, 2–25 nm).

Using vdW-corrected density functional theory calculations, the BP/TiC2 vdW heterostructure was predicted to have excellent structural and mechanical stability, superior electrical conductivity, omnidirectional flexibility, and a high Li storage capacity.

The diffusion behavior is known to be highly sample-dependent, but the reasons for this are less well understood. Here, rutile is studied by using first-principles calculations, in order to unravel the microscopic origins of the diverse diffusion behaviors for different doping elements. Anomalous diffusion behavior in the open channel along the [001] direction is found: larger atoms including Sc and Zr have lower energy barrier for diffusion via interstitial mechanism, apparently contradicting their known slow diffusion rate. To resolve this, we present an alternate model for the overall diffusion rate of the large-size dopants in rutile, showing that parallel to the [001] channel, it is limited by the formation of the interstitial states, whereas in the direction perpendicular to [001], it proceeds via a kick-out mechanism. By contrast, Co and Ni prefer to stay in the interstitial site of rutile, and have conventional diffusion with a very small migration barrier in the [001] channel. This leads to highly anisotropic and fast diffusion. The diffusion mechanisms found in the present study can explain the diffusion data measured by experiments.",

It is found that the valence electron concentration can be used as the key descriptor to evaluate the SFE of Nb matrix, which is applicable to both binary and ternary alloys. The microscopic mechanism arises from the electron redistribution in the local stacking fault area. Moreover, for ternary Nb-Ti based alloys, the interaction between Ti and the third alloying elements has negligible effect on the SFE of the systems, and the valence-electron rule still dominates. The alloying effects on the ductility are further illustrated based on the ratio between surface energies and SFEs. The composition-SFE-ductility map obtained by our theoretical calculations is calibrated by available experimental data.",

Here, by first-principles calculations we studied the surface oxygen-vacancies (Vos) induced electronic-structure variation of HfO2, in order to explore its potential applications in surface-controlled electronic devices. Firstly, it is found that single Vo tends to segregate onto the surface and attracts each other as they form pairs, making the formation of vacancies-contained functional surface possible. Then extensive Vo-chains whose formation/rupture can represent the high/low conductivity state are constructed. The electronic states induced by the Vos remain localized in the band-gap region for most of the Vo-chains studied here. A transition to a metallic conductance is found in metastable Vo-chain with formation energy increased by 0.25 eV per Vo. Moreover, we highlight the significance of the Hubbard U correction for density functional theory when studying the electronic-structure based conductance in the oxides. By comprehensive calculations, we find a conductivity-stability dilemma of the Vo-chains, providing guideline for understanding and designing the electronic devices based on HfO2 surface.",

The calculated formation energies and elastic constants show that all the alloyed Ni3Al are thermodynamically and mechanically stable. It is found that alloying elements W has similar effects on the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of Ni3Al to those of Re, which suggests a possibility of replacing Re with W in Ni-based single crystal superalloys. In addition, co-alloyings with different elements have no distinct synergistic enhancement but simple combined effect on the mechanical properties of Ni3Al. The enhanced chemical bondings between the alloying atoms W/Re and the neighboring host atoms Ni are considered to be the main strengthening mechanisms in W/Re alloyed Ni3Al systems.",

Furthermore, we reveal that the element Al plays a major role in promoting L12 structure more stable than D019 structure for the Co3(Al, W), and the element W reduces metastability as well as improves the strength of L12. We also find that most of the L12-Co3(Al, M) compounds possess good mechanical stability and ductility, which are verified by the elastic constants and Poisson’s ratio. More importantly, the element Cr can be used to replace the W of L12-Co3(Al, W) to increase the strength to weight ratio as the L12-Co3(Al, Cr) possesses comparable elastic properties to the L12-Co3(Al, W), including the Young’s and shear moduli. It is also observed that all the L12-Co3(Al, M) compounds show a high degree of elastic anisotropy. The electron localized function and suggests that the rise of the Young’s moduli in Co3(Al, M), with the alloying element M changing from group IVB to VIB, is mainly attributed by the increasing bonding strength of the nearby transition-metal atoms.

For 1 QL, Seebeck coefficient has been greatly enhanced due to the increase in the number of band extrema by virtue of the twelvefold valley degeneracy from surface states.

Our results indicate that the functionalization of O significantly decreases both the lattice and electron thermal conductivities of Ti2C MXenes because O will induce not only a shorter phonon relaxation time but also a metal–semiconductor transition, showing great potential for applications including thermoelectrics. In contrast to O, after being functionalized by F or OH both the lattice and electron thermal conductivities are increased, which will improve heat dissipation in electronics and batteries.

Herein, we highlighted that compared with other well-studied 2D materials (such as graphene, 2D MoS2), MXene are more likely to contain vacancies with defect formation energies as low as 0.96 eV. The difference of vacancy formation energy for MXenes mainly originates from the variation of M-X bonding strengths. Furthermore, the vacancy defect will enhance the adsorption of Li in the region near the defect through acting as a potential trap, which may cause the first cycle irreversibility for lithiation/delithiation process in Mo2C MXene LIBs. Nevertheless, Li tends to migrate on defect-free surface of Mo2C MXene with energy barrier of 0.096-0.115 eV and thus this potential trap has a minor influence on the charge-discharge rate of Mo2C MXene LIBs.

Using Sc as an example the doping effect on the structure and property of Sb2Te3 has been extensively investigated. The band gap of Sb2Te3 linearly increases with increasing the Sc concentration by ab initio calculations, and our experimental results confirm the theoretical findings. Furthermore, based on the semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory, Sc can significantly decrease the electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of Sb2Te3, and therefore reduced energy consumption of Sb2Te3-based PCM is expected. Finally, the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that Scandium can significantly improve the thermal stability of amorphous Sc-doped Sb2Te3, and hence the enhanced data reliability of Sb2Te3-based PCM.

Adopting recent theoretical models for twinning based on GSFE, increasing temperature enhances the twinnability of low-Mo alloys but has limited influences in the case of high-Mo alloys. The composition-dependent thermal expansion, the thermal electronic excitation and the magnetic transition are shown to be the main factors rendering the complex variations in the elastic properties and twinning behavior of Ni-Mo solid solution with temperature.",

Taking the AlCoCrFeNi2.1 multi-component alloy as a prototype system, the effect of local ordering on its configuration stability and elastic properties were investigated from the aspects of lattice mismatch, modulus mismatch, and chemical bonding, through ab initio calculations. We highlighted that for the bcc phase at 0K, local ordering enhances configuration stability, while it has little influence on the elastic Young's modulus and shear modulus due to severe lattice distortion and elastic distortion in fully disordered configuration. Interestingly, with the increase of temperature, the structural stability and bulk modulus of the partially disordered configuration turns out to be higher than the fully disordered configuration, likely owing to the presence of strong chemical bonding between Al and X(Co, Cr, Fe, Ni). As for the fcc phase in the AlCoCrFeNi2.1 alloy, the degree of local ordering is low and thus results in little difference on the elastic properties between the partially disordered and fully disordered configurations. We believe that our results benefit to the understanding of stabilization mechanism and adjustable mechanical performance of multi-component alloys by considering local ordering.",

With the rapid development of flexible electronics, it is highly desirable to search or design high-performance QSH insulators with excellent flexibility and large bandgap, which is still a huge challenge. Here, using first-principles calculations, we report that surface oxygen functionalization can transform two-dimensional (2D) GaSe monolayer from a trivial insulator to a nontrivial topological insulator with superior stretchability. The fully O-functionalized GaSe monolayer, GaSeO, exhibits a sizable QSH gap of 178 meV, in which the topological nature is characterized by the nontrivial Z(2) topological invariant and the topological edge states. The nontrivial band topology originates from the s-p band inversion in the crystal field. Remarkably, the GaSeO monolayer shows isotropic mechanical flexibility and can sustain large strains of up to 26%, beyond graphene and 2D flexible Ti2C. Furthermore, the QSH state of GaSeO is robust against small elastic strains. The discovery of this 2D flexible and large-gap QSH insulator opens up new opportunities for developing stretchable and low-power electronic devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

Moreover, the intensity of e-p scattering is close to that of p-p scattering at 300 K in sharp contrast to normal cases. This abnormal e-p scattering is understood by a specific feature that the energy difference between occupied and empty electron states near the Fermi level is in the order of the characteristic phonon energy. By calculating the phonon transport property of 2D Nb2C, we show that this strong e-p scattering can result in great reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity.Our work also highlights a new way for searching novel 2D materials with low lattice thermal conductivity.",

Yet the C configuration in polycrystalline GST and its microscopic role is unclear. Using the well-studied GeSb2Te4 as an example, this work unravels the microscopic C doping role based on ab initio calculations. Our results reveal that carbon prefers occupying the interstitials at very low C concentrations, while with a roughly critical C concentration of over 2%, carbon atoms will cluster at the grain boundaries, with very few carbon atoms might exist at the interstitials. With further increasing the C concentrations, C atoms tend to form ring-like configurations in the grain boundaries rather than chain-like configurations. This is due to that the covalent bonds in ring-like configurations are stronger than that in chain-like configurations. Further analysis on the lone-pair electrons and electronic densities of states show that C dopants significantly change the number of lone-pair electrons of surrounding atoms, thus affecting the electronic structure. Finally, the diffusion coefficient of C is estimated to be of the order of 10(-13)m(2)/s at 400 K, indicating the good stability of C dopants in GeSb2Te4. Our work provides fundamental understanding on the microscopic role of C doping in GST phase-change materials and benefits for improving the properties of the recording materials by controlling the doping concentration.",

In the present work, tuning the energetic and kinetics of hydrogen at the Sigma 5(210)[001] GB of Ni by the alloying elements are studied using a comprehensive calculation. Firstly, the metallic elements that tend to stay at the GB are screened from 12 normally used alloying elements. It is found that as the size of the alloying element increases to 30% larger than Ni, its segregation tendency at the GB increases dramatically. The GB-segregated elements reconstruct the energy-landscape of the GB for hydrogen, significantly affecting the segregation and diffusion of hydrogen. Based on the calculations of the attempt frequency and energy barrier, we find that at room temperature the jump rate of hydrogen for the rate-determining step in the long-distance diffusion can be decreased by 5-10 orders (direction dependent), as Al, Ta, W or Zr is alloyed. Meanwhile, the pathway of the rate-limiting jump of H can be diverted in the presence of the alloying element. Thus the alloyed GB can act as an obstacle for the diffusion of hydrogen rather than a fast diffusion channel as in the case of a clean GB. The theoretical results are compared to the available experimental data. The present work provides valuable guidelines for improving the HE resistance of Ni alloys via grain boundary engineering.

We reveal that the successful achievements of the SB-free hole contacts at these MoS2/MXene interfaces depend on not only the high work functions of the MXenes but also the absence of the formation of interfacial gap states that usually result in strong Fermi level pinning in the midgap of a semiconductor. We further propose that efficient charge injection into MoS2 facilitated by SB-free contact could also increase the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the 2H-MoS2 basal plane by improving its conductivity as well as its ability to adsorb hydrogen.

The controllable bandgap of MXenes stems from the fact that the electronic states near the Fermi level have different responses to tensile strain. The stress–strain curves and phonon spectra suggest that semiconducting MXenes can maintain their stability during a wide range of strains. Moreover, the optical dielectric constants of MXenes are red-shifted and enhanced continuously via applying tensile strains.
